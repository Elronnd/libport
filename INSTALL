- Run copy_necessary_files.sh on an appropriate directory to get all of your
  perl6 files somewhere where we can see them.  You probably want /usr, but if
  you have installed perl6 somewhere else, point it somewhere else.  The script
  currently only works on unix; patches to make it work on macos or windows
  welcome!

- Run 'make'.  If you had to point copy_necessary_files at somewhere other than
  /usr, then you will need to run 'make HEADER_DIR=<that directory>/include' or
  similar.  You may need to install perl6/rakudo development files, as separate
  from the interpreter itself--package called perl6-dev or something like that.

- You can try running the example program, or reading its code at src/example.c
